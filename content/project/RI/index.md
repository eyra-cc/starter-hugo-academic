summary: We model choices of a person (a doer) whose preferences and considerations sets can be strategically manipulated by another agent (a planner) via costly unobserved incentives. This interpretation can be interpersonal — where the planner and the doer are distinct individuals—or intrapersonal where the planner motivates her future self. In general, doers can be motivated by advertising, monetary transfers, commitments, and other techniques. We model choice functions that are consistent with a broad class of such incentive schemes. Our main axiom relaxes the classic WARP, but in a way different than the rationalization and inattention effects in Manzini and Mariotti (2007) and Masatlioglu, Nakajima, and Ozbay (2012) respectively. Besides axiomatic foundations, we provide revelation principles in all of these frameworks. Without loss in gen-
erality, every incentive scheme can be identified as a utility function that is imposed on the doer. Equivalently, the planner can select the doer’s consideration sets without perturbing his utility. The interpretations with unobserved monetary transfers allow a simple welfare analysis. Our model has natural extensions to incomplete datasets and preferences over menus.
