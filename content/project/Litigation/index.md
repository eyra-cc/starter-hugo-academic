To delegate  future choices, planners can influence doers in various ways.
In the intrapersonal case,  a planner can  motivate her future self
by   commitments, promises, deadlines  etc.
In the interpersonal case, doers can be selected and/or persuaded to change their beliefs.
Even if delegations and persuasions are not observed directly, they can be still revealed through
other choice primitives.
We obtain this identification from  planners' preferences over  menus in a consumption space Z.
All possible delegations are derived as an endogenous class of doers' rankings of Z,
and  can  be further refined by expected utility when Z consists of lotteries or uncertain prospects.
The latter case can be interpreted in terms of persuasions that  affect the doer's beliefs without changing her risk attitude.
In this interpretation, the set of  possible beliefs is identified uniquely.
A further refinement of this model captures a planner who  knows objective probabilities and can use them in persuasion.
Finally, we discuss how delegations can be revealed through choices in menus rather than among menus.
