This is my Job Market Paper.

I refine the random utility model (RUM) of Block and Marschak (1959) and represent stochastic choice data with quasi-linear types. These types reflect heterogeneous preferences of a group of agents or a single agent across repeated questions. In my framework, choices are observed across pairs of consumption goods and money. Such primitives provide unique identification for the probability measure over the underlying quasi-linear types. Moreover, my model implies a unique social welfare aggregator that is consistent with Pareto efficiency criteria.
