We relax the random expected utility model of Gul and Pesendorfer (2006)
and allow  salience effects where  the likelihood of maximizing any particular type depends on whether its maximizer is salient in a particular menu.
As a special case, we obtain the random expected utility model with certainty effects where salient payoffs must be  deterministic.
To simplify   axioms and tie-breaking rules, we use only finite menus and  constrain the number of possible types to be finite as well.
Our main results are based on a refinement of  the multi-utility model of Aizerman and Malishevsky (1981).
